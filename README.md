# LisPython
Lisp interpreter written in Python

# HIERARCHY OF EXECUTION

## Lexer 
This component is executed first, as it reads the source code 
and generates a stream of tokens that represent the syntax of the code.

## Parser 
This component is executed after the lexer, as it reads 
the stream of tokens generated by the lexer and constructs an 
Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) that represents the structure of the code.

## Interpreter (core)
This component is executed after the parser, as it 
traverses the AST and executes the code it represents.

## Environment 
This component is executed in conjunction with the interpreter core, 
as it keeps track of the values of variables and other stateful information as the code is executed.

## Built-in functions 
These functions are available throughout the execution of the code, 
as they are built into the interpreter and can be called by the code being interpreted.

## REPL
This component allows users to interactively enter and execute code, 
and is typically used as an interface to the interpreter.
